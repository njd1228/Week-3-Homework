<!--•	PseudoCode: Hangman
•	Computer presents word with spaces in place of the letters.
•	Player guesses letters
•	When they answer correctly (or when they guess one of the letters) the computer fills in the corresponding letter
•	When they answer incorrectly, the computer logs the wrong letter on the screen so the user can see it, and then takes away one of their chances
•	The player gets 15 chances/guesses to get the word correct
•	The title of the page should give a hint as to the type of word the player is guessing i.e. rock n roll bands etc.-->
